# Quality gates and evidence receipts

## Layered evaluation

1. **Meaningful RED/GREEN** — show the intended behavior fails for the right reason, then passes after implementation.
2. **Affected tests** — cover changed behavior, callers, contracts, and known impact surfaces.
3. **Required full/build gates** — satisfy repository policy with clean builds/full suites where required.
4. **Complexity and coverage debt** — measure changed-code risk and prevent unapproved threshold/baseline regression.
5. **Mutation strength** — use survivors to drive real behavior tests; enumeration must be complete enough for the claimed scope.
6. **Independent cross-family review** — review the exact patch/head with a genuinely independent model/tool family where policy requires it.

Scope is risk-proportionate. Documentation-only work may mark code/test/mutation gates `NOT_APPLICABLE`, but each N/A needs a concrete reason.

## Gate outcomes

Every gate returns exactly one outcome: `PASS`, `FAIL`, `INCOMPLETE`, `ERROR`, or `NOT_APPLICABLE`. Timeout, unsupported capability, missing coverage/artifacts, truncated results, or incomplete mutation enumeration never map to `PASS`.

## Receipt contract

Every receipt records gate/policy IDs; base/head/tree; tool version and detected capability; config and baseline identity; exact command/invocation; scope; timestamps/exit state; outcome/reason; artifact paths/hashes; limitations/exclusions/missing data/N/A rationale; and whether source/tree changed during evaluation. Receipts are append-only evidence; summaries cannot erase failures or limitations.

## Baseline and policy ownership

Roll out from advisory reporting to reviewed baseline/exemption registries, then enforce no unapproved changed-code regression. Workers cannot weaken thresholds, omit required projects, broaden exemptions, regenerate a favorable baseline, or self-approve policy changes. Mutation survivors prompt stronger behavior tests, not suppression.

## Exact-patch review

Independent review binds to base/head/tree and exact patch hash. Edits, amend, rebase, conflict resolution, generated changes, or dependency integration trigger invalidation assessment. Material patch changes require fresh review.

## Failure scenarios kept visible

Stale plan/changed base; conflicting writer/uncertain lease; interrupted command; incomplete mutation enumeration; missing/stale coverage; baseline/exemption gaming; review of another patch/head; green partial tests without required full gates; and installed tools lacking required capability.
